                                             WELCOME TO BASIC OS
									
HERE:-

os.asm : assembly file to be compiled.
os : binary file made by assembler.
os.iso: it is bootable disk image.

Now, you will find the iso image to be empty, because the iso image don't contain any file
it only contains the boot information from bootloader os.
